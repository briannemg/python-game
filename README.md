# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Python CLI Version)

A two-player command-line Tic Tac Toe game built in Python, featuring a custom letter-based board layout, player name input, randomized turns, win/draw detection, and replay fuctionality.

---

## 🤔 Why I Built This

I wanted a fun way to sharpen my Python skills, particularly object-oriented programming and user input handling. This classic game was the perfect excuse to play with classes, dictionaries, and ASCII art.

Plus, I gave it a twist: the board spaces use single-letter labels (`A`-`J`, skipping `I`) instead of traditional coordinates. Because why not?

## 🧠 Features

- 🎲 Randomized player order (coin flip)
- 🔤 Custom board labels: `A` through `J` (skipping `I`)
- 👤 Player name input
- 🧠 Win/draw detection
- ♻️ Replay functionality
- 📦 Fully modular OOP design using a `TicTacToeGame` class

Players type the letter corresponding to the space where they want to move (e.g., `E`). The game tracks turns, checks for wins/draws, and asks if you'd like to play again.
